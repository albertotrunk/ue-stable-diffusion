"""
This module provides a basic "weak method" implementation, WeakMethod. It uses
weakref.WeakRef which, used on its own, produces weak methods that are dead on
creation, not very useful. Use the getWeakRef(object) module function to create the
proper type of weak reference (weakref.WeakRef or WeakMethod) for given object.
