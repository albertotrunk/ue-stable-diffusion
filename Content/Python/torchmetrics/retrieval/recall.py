class RetrievalRecall(RetrievalMetric):
    """Computes `IR Recall`_.

    Works with binary target data. Accepts float predictions from a model output.

    As input to ``forward`` and ``update`` the metric accepts the following input:

    - ``preds`` (:class:`~torch.Tensor`): A float tensor of shape ``(N, ...)``
    - ``target`` (:class:`~torch.Tensor`): A long or bool tensor of shape ``(N, ...)``
    - ``indexes`` (:class:`~torch.Tensor`): A long tensor of shape ``(N, ...)`` which indicate to which query a
      prediction belongs

    As output to ``forward`` and ``compute`` the metric returns the following output:

    - ``r2`` (:class:`~torch.Tensor`): A single-value tensor with the recall (at ``k``) of the predictions
      ``preds`` w.r.t. the labels ``target``

    All ``indexes``, ``preds`` and ``target`` must have the same dimension and will be flatten at the beginning,
    so that for example, a tensor of shape ``(N, M)`` is treated as ``(N * M, )``. Predictions will be first grouped by
    ``indexes`` and then will be computed as the mean of the metric over each query.

    Args:
        empty_target_action:
            Specify what to do with queries that do not have at least a positive ``target``. Choose from:

            - ``'neg'``: those queries count as ``0.0`` (default)
            - ``'pos'``: those queries count as ``1.0``
            - ``'skip'``: skip those queries; if all queries are skipped, ``0.0`` is returned
            - ``'error'``: raise a ``ValueError``

        ignore_index: Ignore predictions where the target is equal to this number.
        k: consider only the top k elements for each query (default: `None`, which considers them all)
        kwargs: Additional keyword arguments, see :ref:`Metric kwargs` for more info.

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If ``empty_target_action`` is not one of ``error``, ``skip``, ``neg`` or ``pos``.
        ValueError:
            If ``ignore_index`` is not `None` or an integer.
        ValueError:
            If ``k`` parameter is not `None` or an integer larger than 0.

    Example:
        >>> from torchmetrics import RetrievalRecall
        >>> indexes = tensor([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1])
        >>> preds = tensor([0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.2])
        >>> target = tensor([False, False, True, False, True, False, True])
        >>> r2 = RetrievalRecall(k=2)
        >>> r2(preds, target, indexes=indexes)
