    .. math::
        \text{Accuracy} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i^N 1(y_i = \hat{y}_i)

    Where :math:`y` is a tensor of target values, and :math:`\hat{y}` is a
    tensor of predictions.

    Accepts the following input tensors:

    - ``preds`` (int or float tensor): ``(N, ...)``. If preds is a floating point tensor with values outside
      [0,1] range we consider the input to be logits and will auto apply sigmoid per element. Addtionally,
      we convert to int tensor with thresholding using the value in ``threshold``.
    - ``target`` (int tensor): ``(N, ...)``

    The influence of the additional dimension ``...`` (if present) will be determined by the `multidim_average`
    argument.

    Args:
        threshold: Threshold for transforming probability to binary {0,1} predictions
        multidim_average:
            Defines how additionally dimensions ``...`` should be handled. Should be one of the following:

            - ``global``: Additional dimensions are flatted along the batch dimension
            - ``samplewise``: Statistic will be calculated independently for each sample on the ``N`` axis.
              The statistics in this case are calculated over the additional dimensions.

        ignore_index:
            Specifies a target value that is ignored and does not contribute to the metric calculation
        validate_args: bool indicating if input arguments and tensors should be validated for correctness.
            Set to ``False`` for faster computations.

    Returns:
        If ``multidim_average`` is set to ``global``, the metric returns a scalar value. If ``multidim_average``
        is set to ``samplewise``, the metric returns ``(N,)`` vector consisting of a scalar value per sample.

class Accuracy(StatScores):

    .. note::
        From v0.10 an ``'binary_*'``, ``'multiclass_*'``, ``'multilabel_*'`` version now exist of each classification
        metric. Moving forward we recommend using these versions. This base metric will still work as it did
        prior to v0.10 until v0.11. From v0.11 the `task` argument introduced in this metric will be required
        and the general order of arguments may change, such that this metric will just function as an single
        entrypoint to calling the three specialized versions.

    Computes Accuracy_:

    .. math::
        \text{Accuracy} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i^N 1(y_i = \hat{y}_i)

    Where :math:`y` is a tensor of target values, and :math:`\hat{y}` is a
    tensor of predictions.

    For multi-class and multi-dimensional multi-class data with probability or logits predictions, the
    parameter ``top_k`` generalizes this metric to a Top-K accuracy metric: for each sample the
    top-K highest probability or logit score items are considered to find the correct label.

    For multi-label and multi-dimensional multi-class inputs, this metric computes the "global"
    accuracy by default, which counts all labels or sub-samples separately. This can be
    changed to subset accuracy (which requires all labels or sub-samples in the sample to
    be correctly predicted) by setting ``subset_accuracy=True``.

    Accepts all input types listed in :ref:`pages/classification:input types`.

    Args:
        num_classes:
            Number of classes. Necessary for ``'macro'``, ``'weighted'`` and ``None`` average methods.
        threshold:
            Threshold for transforming probability or logit predictions to binary (0,1) predictions, in the case
            of binary or multi-label inputs. Default value of 0.5 corresponds to input being probabilities.
        average:
            Defines the reduction that is applied. Should be one of the following:

            - ``'micro'`` [default]: Calculate the metric globally, across all samples and classes.
            - ``'macro'``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and average the
              metrics across classes (with equal weights for each class).
            - ``'weighted'``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and average the
              metrics across classes, weighting each class by its support (``tp + fn``).
            - ``'none'`` or ``None``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and return
              the metric for every class.
            - ``'samples'``: Calculate the metric for each sample, and average the metrics
              across samples (with equal weights for each sample).

            .. note:: What is considered a sample in the multi-dimensional multi-class case
                depends on the value of ``mdmc_average``.

            .. note:: If ``'none'`` and a given class doesn't occur in the ``preds`` or ``target``,
                the value for the class will be ``nan``.

        mdmc_average:
            Defines how averaging is done for multi-dimensional multi-class inputs (on top of the
            ``average`` parameter). Should be one of the following:

            - ``None`` [default]: Should be left unchanged if your data is not multi-dimensional
              multi-class.

            - ``'samplewise'``: In this case, the statistics are computed separately for each
              sample on the ``N`` axis, and then averaged over samples.
              The computation for each sample is done by treating the flattened extra axes ``...``
              (see :ref:`pages/classification:input types`) as the ``N`` dimension within the sample,
              and computing the metric for the sample based on that.

            - ``'global'``: In this case the ``N`` and ``...`` dimensions of the inputs
              (see :ref:`pages/classification:input types`)
              are flattened into a new ``N_X`` sample axis, i.e. the inputs are treated as if they
              were ``(N_X, C)``. From here on the ``average`` parameter applies as usual.

        ignore_index:
            Integer specifying a target class to ignore. If given, this class index does not contribute
            to the returned score, regardless of reduction method. If an index is ignored, and ``average=None``
            or ``'none'``, the score for the ignored class will be returned as ``nan``.

        top_k:
            Number of the highest probability or logit score predictions considered finding the correct label,
            relevant only for (multi-dimensional) multi-class inputs. The
            default value (``None``) will be interpreted as 1 for these inputs.

            Should be left at default (``None``) for all other types of inputs.

        multiclass:
            Used only in certain special cases, where you want to treat inputs as a different type
            than what they appear to be. See the parameter's
            :ref:`documentation section <pages/classification:using the multiclass parameter>`
            for a more detailed explanation and examples.

        subset_accuracy:
            Whether to compute subset accuracy for multi-label and multi-dimensional
            multi-class inputs (has no effect for other input types).

            - For multi-label inputs, if the parameter is set to ``True``, then all labels for
              each sample must be correctly predicted for the sample to count as correct. If it
              is set to ``False``, then all labels are counted separately - this is equivalent to
              flattening inputs beforehand (i.e. ``preds = preds.flatten()`` and same for ``target``).

            - For multi-dimensional multi-class inputs, if the parameter is set to ``True``, then all
              sub-sample (on the extra axis) must be correct for the sample to be counted as correct.
              If it is set to ``False``, then all sub-samples are counter separately - this is equivalent,
              in the case of label predictions, to flattening the inputs beforehand (i.e.
              ``preds = preds.flatten()`` and same for ``target``). Note that the ``top_k`` parameter
              still applies in both cases, if set.

        kwargs: Additional keyword arguments, see :ref:`Metric kwargs` for more info.

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If ``top_k`` is not an ``integer`` larger than ``0``.
        ValueError:
            If ``average`` is none of ``"micro"``, ``"macro"``, ``"weighted"``, ``"samples"``, ``"none"``, ``None``.
        ValueError:
            If two different input modes are provided, eg. using ``multi-label`` with ``multi-class``.
        ValueError:
            If ``top_k`` parameter is set for ``multi-label`` inputs.
