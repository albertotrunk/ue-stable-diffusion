class LearnedPerceptualImagePatchSimilarity(Metric):
    """The Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (`LPIPS_`) is used to judge the perceptual similarity between
    two images. LPIPS essentially computes the similarity between the activations of two image patches for some
    pre-defined network. This measure has been shown to match human perception well. A low LPIPS score means that
    image patches are perceptual similar.

    Both input image patches are expected to have shape ``(N, 3, H, W)``.
    The minimum size of `H, W` depends on the chosen backbone (see `net_type` arg).

    .. note:: using this metrics requires you to have ``lpips`` package installed. Either install
        as ``pip install torchmetrics[image]`` or ``pip install lpips``

    .. note:: this metric is not scriptable when using ``torch<1.8``. Please update your pytorch installation
        if this is a issue.

    As input to ``forward`` and ``update`` the metric accepts the following input

    - ``img1`` (:class:`~torch.Tensor`): tensor with images of shape ``(N, 3, H, W)``
    - ``img2`` (:class:`~torch.Tensor`): tensor with images of shape ``(N, 3, H, W)``

    As output of `forward` and `compute` the metric returns the following output

    - ``lpips`` (:class:`~torch.Tensor`): returns float scalar tensor with average LPIPS value over samples

    Args:
        net_type: str indicating backbone network type to use. Choose between `'alex'`, `'vgg'` or `'squeeze'`
        reduction: str indicating how to reduce over the batch dimension. Choose between `'sum'` or `'mean'`.
        normalize: by default this is ``False`` meaning that the input is expected to be in the [-1,1] range. If set
            to ``True`` will instead expect input to be in the ``[0,1]`` range.
        kwargs: Additional keyword arguments, see :ref:`Metric kwargs` for more info.

    Raises:
        ModuleNotFoundError:
            If ``lpips`` package is not installed
        ValueError:
            If ``net_type`` is not one of ``"vgg"``, ``"alex"`` or ``"squeeze"``
        ValueError:
            If ``reduction`` is not one of ``"mean"`` or ``"sum"``

    Example:
        >>> import torch
        >>> _ = torch.manual_seed(123)
        >>> from torchmetrics.image.lpip import LearnedPerceptualImagePatchSimilarity
        >>> lpips = LearnedPerceptualImagePatchSimilarity(net_type='vgg')
        >>> # LPIPS needs the images to be in the [-1, 1] range.
        >>> img1 = (torch.rand(10, 3, 100, 100) * 2) - 1
        >>> img2 = (torch.rand(10, 3, 100, 100) * 2) - 1
        >>> lpips(img1, img2)
