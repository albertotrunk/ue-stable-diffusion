class SavePlanner(abc.ABC):
    """
    Abstract class defining the protocol used by save_state_dict to plan the save process.

    SavePlanners are stateful objects that can be used to customize the whole save process.

    SavePlanner acts as an access proxy to the state_dict, so any transfomation done to it
    will be visible to the whole process.

    A planner subclass can expect the following sequence of calls during save_state_dict:

    1) init - called on all ranks.
        Signals the start of a checkpoint save.

    2) create_local_plan - called on all ranks.
        Process the state_dict and produces a `SavePlan` that will be sent for global planning.

    3) create_global_plan - called on the coordinator rank only.
        Takes the SavePlan from all ranks and make any global decision.

    4) finish_plan - called on all ranks.
        This gives each rank a chance to adjust to global planning decisions.

    5) resolve_data - called multiple times on each rank
        Lookups a value on the `state_dict` for the storage layer to write.

    Users are recomended to extend DefaultSavePlanner instead of this interface directly as
    most changes can be expressed by changes in a single method.

    There are 3 usual patterns of extension:

    Rewriting state_dict. This is the simplest way to extend the save process as it
    doesn't requite understanding the intrincacies of how SavePlan works:

    >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("undefined vars")
    >>> class RenamePlanner(DefaultSavePlanner):
    >>>     def init(self, state_dict, is_coordinator):
    >>>         # prefix all keys with `foo_``
    >>>         super().init(self, {"foo_" + k: v for k, v in state_dict.items()}, is_coordinator)

    Modifying local plan and lookup in tandem. This is useful when fine control of how data is persisted

    >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("undefined vars")
    >>> class FP16Planner(DefaultSavePlanner):
    >>>     def create_local_plan(self):
    >>>         plan = super().create_local_plan()
    >>>         for p in plan:
    >>>             if p.tensor_data is not None:
    >>>                 p.tensor_data.properties.dtype = torch.float16
    >>>
    >>>     def resolve_data(self, write_item):
    >>>         item = super().resolve_data(write_item)
    >>>         return item if write_item.type == WriteItemType.BYTE_IO else item.to(torch.float16)

    Using the global planning step to make central decisions that can't be made individually by each rank

    >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("undefined vars")
    >>> from itertools import islice
    >>> from dataclasses import replace
    >>> class DDPLoadBalancingPlanner(DefaultSavePlanner):
    >>>     # This uses the default local plan behavior of having all non-sharded writes in rank 0
    >>>     # This sample doesn't handle ShardedTensors
    >>>     def create_global_plan(self, all_plans):
    >>>         def chunk(it, size):
    >>>             it = iter(it)
    >>>         return list(iter(lambda: tuple(islice(it, size)), ()))
    >>>         all_plans = [
    >>>             replace(plan, items=items) for plan, items in
    >>>                 zip(all_plans, chunk(all_plans[0].items, len(all_plans)))
    >>>         ]
    >>>         return super().create_global_plan(all_plans)

    Finally, some planners need to save additional metadata in the checkpoint, this is
    accomplished by having each rank contribute their data items in the local plan and
    the global planner aggregate them:

    >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("undefined vars")
    >>> class SaveExtraDataPlanner(DefaultSavePlanner):
    >>>     def create_local_plan(self) -> SavePlan:
    >>>         plan = super().create_local_plan()
    >>>         return replace(plan, planner_data="per-rank-data")
    >>>
    >>>     def create_global_plan(self, all_plans: List[SavePlan]) -> Tuple[List[SavePlan], Metadata]:
    >>>         global_plan, metadata = super().create_global_plan(all_plans)
    >>>         merged_data = [p.planner_data for p in global_plan]
    >>>         metadata = replace(metadata, planner_data=merged_data)
    >>>         return global_plan, metadata
