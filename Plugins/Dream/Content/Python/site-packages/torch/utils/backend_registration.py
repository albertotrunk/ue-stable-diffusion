    rename_privateuse1_backend(backend_name) -> None

    This is a registration API for external backends that would like to register their
    own device and C++ kernels out of tree.

    The steps are:
    (1) (In C++) implement kernels for various torch operations, and register them
        to the PrivateUse1 dispatch key.
    (2) (In python) call torch.register_privateuse1_backend("foo")

    You can now use "foo" as an ordinary device string in python.

    Note: this API can only be called once per process. Attempting to change
    the external backend after it's already been set will result in an error.

    For an existing example, see https://github.com/bdhirsh/pytorch_open_registration_example

    Example::

        >>> torch.register_privateuse1_backend("foo")
        # This will work, assuming that you've implemented the right C++ kernels
        # to implement torch.ones.
        >>> a = torch.ones(2, device="foo")
        """
    return _rename_privateuse1_backend(backend_name)
