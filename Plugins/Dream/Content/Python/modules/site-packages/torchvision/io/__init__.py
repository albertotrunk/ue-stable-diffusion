class VideoReader:
    """
    Fine-grained video-reading API.
    Supports frame-by-frame reading of various streams from a single video
    container.

    Example:
        The following examples creates a :mod:`VideoReader` object, seeks into 2s
        point, and returns a single frame::

            import torchvision
            video_path = "path_to_a_test_video"
            reader = torchvision.io.VideoReader(video_path, "video")
            reader.seek(2.0)
            frame = next(reader)

        :mod:`VideoReader` implements the iterable API, which makes it suitable to
        using it in conjunction with :mod:`itertools` for more advanced reading.
        As such, we can use a :mod:`VideoReader` instance inside for loops::

            reader.seek(2)
            for frame in reader:
                frames.append(frame['data'])
            # additionally, `seek` implements a fluent API, so we can do
            for frame in reader.seek(2):
                frames.append(frame['data'])

        With :mod:`itertools`, we can read all frames between 2 and 5 seconds with the
        following code::

            for frame in itertools.takewhile(lambda x: x['pts'] <= 5, reader.seek(2)):
                frames.append(frame['data'])

        and similarly, reading 10 frames after the 2s timestamp can be achieved
        as follows::

            for frame in itertools.islice(reader.seek(2), 10):
                frames.append(frame['data'])

    .. note::

        Each stream descriptor consists of two parts: stream type (e.g. 'video') and
        a unique stream id (which are determined by the video encoding).
        In this way, if the video contaner contains multiple
        streams of the same type, users can acces the one they want.
        If only stream type is passed, the decoder auto-detects first stream of that type.

    Args:

        path (string): Path to the video file in supported format

        stream (string, optional): descriptor of the required stream, followed by the stream id,
            in the format ``{stream_type}:{stream_id}``. Defaults to ``"video:0"``.
