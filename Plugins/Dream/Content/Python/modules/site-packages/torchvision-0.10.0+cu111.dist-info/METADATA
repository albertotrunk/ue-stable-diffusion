The torchvision package consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision.


Installation
============

We recommend Anaconda as Python package management system. Please refer to `pytorch.org <https://pytorch.org/>`_
for the detail of PyTorch (``torch``) installation. The following is the corresponding ``torchvision`` versions and
supported Python versions.

+--------------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------------+
| ``torch``                | ``torchvision``          | ``python``                      |

+--------------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------------+

Anaconda:

.. code:: bash

    conda install torchvision -c pytorch

pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install torchvision

From source:

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py install
    # or, for OSX
    # MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 CC=clang CXX=clang++ python setup.py install


In case building TorchVision from source fails, install the nightly version of PyTorch following 
the linked guide on the  `contributing page <https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-installation>`_ and retry the install.

By default, GPU support is built if CUDA is found and ``torch.cuda.is_available()`` is true.
It's possible to force building GPU support by setting ``FORCE_CUDA=1`` environment variable,
which is useful when building a docker image.

Image Backend
=============
Torchvision currently supports the following image backends:

* `Pillow`_ (default)

* `Pillow-SIMD`_ - a **much faster** drop-in replacement for Pillow with SIMD. If installed will be used as the default.

* `accimage`_ - if installed can be activated by calling :code:`torchvision.set_image_backend('accimage')`

* `libpng`_ - can be installed via conda :code:`conda install libpng` or any of the package managers for debian-based and RHEL-based Linux distributions.

* `libjpeg`_ - can be installed via conda :code:`conda install jpeg` or any of the package managers for debian-based and RHEL-based Linux distributions. `libjpeg-turbo`_ can be used as well.

**Notes:** ``libpng`` and ``libjpeg`` must be available at compilation time in order to be available. Make sure that it is available on the standard library locations,
otherwise, add the include and library paths in the environment variables ``TORCHVISION_INCLUDE`` and ``TORCHVISION_LIBRARY``, respectively.

.. _Pillow : https://python-pillow.org/
.. _Pillow-SIMD : https://github.com/uploadcare/pillow-simd
.. _accimage: https://github.com/pytorch/accimage
.. _libjpeg: http://ijg.org/
.. _libjpeg-turbo: https://libjpeg-turbo.org/

C++ API
=======
TorchVision also offers a C++ API that contains C++ equivalent of python models.

Installation From source:

.. code:: bash

    mkdir build
    cd build
    # Add -DWITH_CUDA=on support for the CUDA if needed
    cmake ..
    make
    make install

Once installed, the library can be accessed in cmake (after properly configuring ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``) via the :code:`TorchVision::TorchVision` target:

.. code:: rest

	find_package(TorchVision REQUIRED)
	target_link_libraries(my-target PUBLIC TorchVision::TorchVision)

The ``TorchVision`` package will also automatically look for the ``Torch`` package and add it as a dependency to ``my-target``,
so make sure that it is also available to cmake via the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``.

For an example setup, take a look at ``examples/cpp/hello_world``.

TorchVision Operators
---------------------
In order to get the torchvision operators registered with torch (eg. for the JIT), all you need to do is to ensure that you
:code:`#include <torchvision/vision.h>` in your project.

Documentation
=============
You can find the API documentation on the pytorch website: https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html

Disclaimer on Datasets
======================

This is a utility library that downloads and prepares public datasets.
