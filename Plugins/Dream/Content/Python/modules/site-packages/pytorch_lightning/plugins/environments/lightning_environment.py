    There are two modes the Lightning environment can operate with:

    1.  The user only launches the main process by :code:`python train.py ...` with no additional environment variables
        set. Lightning will spawn new worker processes for distributed training in the current node.
    2.  The user launches all processes manually or with utilities like :code:`torch.distributed.launch`.
        The appropriate environment variables need to be set, and at minimum :code:`LOCAL_RANK`.

    If the main address and port are not provided, the default environment will choose them
    automatically. It is recommended to use this default environment for single-node distributed
    training as it provides a convenient way to launch the training script.
