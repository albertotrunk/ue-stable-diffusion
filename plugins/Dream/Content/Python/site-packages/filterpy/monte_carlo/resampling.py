def residual_resample(weights):
    """ Performs the residual resampling algorithm used by particle filters.

    Based on observation that we don't need to use random numbers to select
    most of the weights. Take int(N*w^i) samples of each particle i, and then
    resample any remaining using a standard resampling algorithm [1]


    Parameters
    ----------

    Returns
    -------

    indexes : ndarray of ints
        array of indexes into the weights defining the resample. i.e. the
        index of the zeroth resample is indexes[0], etc.
