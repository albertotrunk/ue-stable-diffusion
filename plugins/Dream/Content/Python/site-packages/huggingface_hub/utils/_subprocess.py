    Method to run subprocesses. Calling this will capture the `stderr` and `stdout`,

    be captured.

    Args:
        command (`str` or `List[str]`):
            The command to execute as a string or list of strings.
        folder (`str`, *optional*):
            The folder in which to run the command. Defaults to current working
            directory (from `os.getcwd()`).
        check (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Setting `check` to `True` will raise a `subprocess.CalledProcessError`
            when the subprocess has a non-zero exit code.
        kwargs (`Dict[str]`):
            Keyword arguments to be passed to the `subprocess.run` underlying command.

    Returns:
        `subprocess.CompletedProcess`: The completed process.
