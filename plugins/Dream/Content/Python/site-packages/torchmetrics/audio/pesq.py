class PerceptualEvaluationSpeechQuality(Metric):
    """Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ)

    This is a wrapper for the pesq package [1]. Note that input will be moved to `cpu`
    to perform the metric calculation.

    .. note:: using this metrics requires you to have ``pesq`` install. Either install as ``pip install
        torchmetrics[audio]`` or ``pip install pesq``. Note that ``pesq`` will compile with your currently
        installed version of numpy, meaning that if you upgrade numpy at some point in the future you will
        most likely have to reinstall ``pesq``.

    Forward accepts

    - ``preds``: ``shape [...,time]``
    - ``target``: ``shape [...,time]``

    Args:
        fs: sampling frequency, should be 16000 or 8000 (Hz)
        mode: ``'wb'`` (wide-band) or ``'nb'`` (narrow-band)
        keep_same_device: whether to move the pesq value to the device of preds
        n_processes: integer specifiying the number of processes to run in parallel for the metric calculation.
            Only applies to batches of data and if ``multiprocessing`` package is installed.
        kwargs: Additional keyword arguments, see :ref:`Metric kwargs` for more info.

    Raises:
        ModuleNotFoundError:
            If ``peqs`` package is not installed
        ValueError:
            If ``fs`` is not either  ``8000`` or ``16000``
        ValueError:
            If ``mode`` is not either ``"wb"`` or ``"nb"``

    Example:
        >>> from torchmetrics.audio.pesq import PerceptualEvaluationSpeechQuality
        >>> import torch
        >>> g = torch.manual_seed(1)
        >>> preds = torch.randn(8000)
        >>> target = torch.randn(8000)
        >>> nb_pesq = PerceptualEvaluationSpeechQuality(8000, 'nb')
        >>> nb_pesq(preds, target)
        tensor(2.2076)
        >>> wb_pesq = PerceptualEvaluationSpeechQuality(16000, 'wb')
        >>> wb_pesq(preds, target)
        tensor(1.7359)
